## Features
### Header 
The header is set to stick at the top of the webpage to make sure the nav links are always accessible. It is colored to match the rest of the page. This color was chosen 
as it is a very outdoors color,assocciated with the  sort of adventuras things you will be gitting up to.
The nav and logo have a text color which is easy to read on the background for ease of use. Everything is clear and easy to use.

that runs through the website. the same color is used through-out.
